The TapTrust mobile app using React Native

# Getting Started

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies. 

2. Run `expo start` to start Metro Bundler, and use Expo App or emulator to open the application. 


# Troubleshooting

- If Expo continues to reload the app, it may be because of Dropbox or some other syncing system creating a reloading and file updating loop. Temporarily disable Dropbox during development to avoid this issue, or move the repo to a different location.
